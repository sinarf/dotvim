This is my dot vim configuration.
========

This is my third reboot of my dotvim configuration. I had a bunch of stuff randomly pasted from various place, a big clean up. 

## Prerequisites : 

* curl and git should be installed and fully functionnal. 
* vim should have been built with python support (needed for some plugins).

## Installation

TODO
